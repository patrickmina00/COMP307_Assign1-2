# COMP307_Assign1-2
Part 2: Decision Tree Algorithm
The same can be said on part 2 (referencing part 1) although there were a bit more issues that needed to be addressed 
since this part of the assignment needed to use trees in its implementation. Containing the data read from files is also a 
challenge since there is a lot of relevant information in them. Gaining easy access to the data is also something I had to 
think about while working on this. In the end, I mainly used maps as a form of containing my test data set.


Technology used: Mainly Eclipse
